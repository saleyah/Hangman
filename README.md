Hangman Game using Python (Console-based)
A beginner-friendly word guessing game developed using Python. This project was built using an online compiler and is ideal for learning basic logic building, control flow, and string manipulation in a fun and interactive way.

📌 Features

🎯 Simple terminal-based Hangman gameplay

🧠 Predefined list of words (customizable)

💡 Hints via blank spaces and guess tracking

❌ Limited wrong attempts (max 10 incorrect tries)

🔄 Replay option after game ends

 Technologies Used

Python (Core logic)

Random module for word selection

Basic string and list handling

Console I/O (No external dependencies)

Developed using online compilers like Replit / Programiz / PythonAnywhere

How It Works

1. Select Word: A random word is selected from a fixed list

2. Show Blanks: Each letter is hidden as _

3. Take Guess: User inputs a letter per turn

4. Check Guess: Correct guesses fill the word; wrong guesses reduce chances

5. End Game: Player either completes the word or runs out of tries

6. Restart Option: Prompt to play again

🚀 Learning Outcome

Strengthened Python basics

Improved logic and loop handling

Experience using online IDEs and debuggers
